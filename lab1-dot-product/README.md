Creates two integer arrays a and b, each of length n.

Fills both arrays with randomly generated integer values (you may use java.util.Random or Math.random()).

Computes a third array c such that:

c[i]=a[i]×b[i],for i=0,1,…,n−1
Prints the original arrays a and b, followed by the resulting array c.
