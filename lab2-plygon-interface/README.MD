This project is about interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Instructions:

Define a Polygon interface that has abstract methods area() and perimeter().
Implement concrete classes for Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon. Each class should implement the Polygon interface.
Implement classes for IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square. These classes must have the appropriate inheritance relationships.
Write a simple console-based user interface that allows a user to create polygons of various types, input their dimensions, and then outputs their area and perimeter.
