Simulates a basic calculator using the Java console as the only input and output interface.
Accepts each input—whether a number (e.g., 12.34 or 1034) or an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /, or =) —on a separate line.

After each input, it displays on the console the value that would appear on the calculator’s screen.

Supports continuous calculations until the user decides to exit (optional: you may implement a special input like exit to terminate the program).

Additional Requirement:

Create a UML Class Diagram for your calculator program showing the main classes, attributes, and methods.
