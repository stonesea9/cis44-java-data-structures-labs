Instructions:

Create a Song class to store the title and artist of a song.
Create a Playlist class that uses a Singly Linked List to manage a collection of Song objects.
Implement the following functionalities in your Playlist class:
addSong(Song song): Adds a song to the end of the playlist.
removeSong(String title): Removes the first occurrence of a song with the given title.
playNext(): "Plays" the current song (prints its details) and advances to the next song. This should wrap around to the beginning if the end is reached (like a circular playlist).
displayPlaylist(): Prints all the songs currently in the playlist.
Create a main application class with a simple text menu to interact with the playlist.
Deliverables:

A link to the lab4-singly-linked-list directory on GitHub containing all your Java source files.
Screenshots of your application demonstrating adding songs, displaying the playlist, playing songs, and removing a song.
